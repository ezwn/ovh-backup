# Daniel's version

**What has been your most important achievements on Q3?**
Nico is a highly skilled developer with a strong focus on code reusability and maintainability. He consistently advocates for clean coding practices during code reviews, ensuring that the team maintains a robust and secure codebase. For example, he successfully extracted two key components originally developed for Engage - **new REST BCS library** and **Audit Logs** -which have since been adopted by a wider team at Nexthink.
As the Scrum Master, Nico plays a crucial role in the team’s organization and efficiency. He documented the entire process thoroughly, updated meetings Zoom links, allowing the team to function smoothly in his absence, such as during his PTO.
Some of his other significant contributions include:

* Extracting reusable code from the Engage repository that can be utilized at the Nexthink level, such as the **new REST BCS library** and **Audit Logs** (with the latter still in progress).
* Worked on the technical specifications for both **Audit Logs** and **Communicate More**, and overseeing the entire end-to-end (E2E) process, including testing. His involvement ensured clarity for those who attended all the meetings (Tech Spec presentations and Grooming sessions), though it highlighted the need for clearer task descriptions for those who rely only on written task details.
* Tackling a complex microservice related to **VDI changes** (**euf-tray-communication**), which not only solved a critical challenge but also deepened his understanding of Kafka Stream, further enhancing his technical expertise.
* Did many trainings, which shows the team that continuous learning is well seen for the team. This emphasizes the importance of developing both technical and personal skills, even when the sprint workload is heavy.
* Effectively managing his responsibilities as Scrum Master, ensuring that all processes are well-documented and the team can continue to function efficiently during his absence.

**What have been your biggest challenges?**

* Nico has engaged in several discussions with other team members, sometimes leading to challenges due to differing views on standards or timing of feedback. As a Scrum Master, part of the role is fostering collaboration and cohesion within the team. It’s important to ensure that all opinions are heard and considered to maintain a unified and productive team dynamic.
* There was a case where the documentation for **Communicate More** appeared incomplete or unclear, which is unusual for Nico. This may have overlapped with the stressful period during the **VDI delivery**, potentially affecting the outcome. While we had some discussions, we didn’t have the opportunity to fully explore what caused this issue.
* Occasionally, it felt like Nico was not fully engaged during some presentations. For instance, after the presentation on the **ArgoCD deployment**, it wasn’t clear that the new checkboxes should be used, even though we had a team presentation prior. This lack of clarity is uncharacteristic of Nico, and we should ensure alignment moving forward to avoid such miscommunications.

**What do you think you’ll have to continue/stop/start doing for the next Q's to keep growing?**

**Continue :**

* Being this amazing scrum master with the well done processes put in place and well documented
* Focusing on reusability and maintainability, this is a very gold good standard to pursue as a team
* Learning and improving yourself: doing it via external toolings or even internally by doing E2E tests to fully understand the teams scope

**Start :**

* I would recommend to try to see other people's opinion from "their eye's", what is their culture, why they prefer things like this ? Even have an informal chat with someone and try to understand where they come from, this is a very foundational skill to have in the professional and personal life

**Stop :**

* Not as a stop but rather as improvement : Scrum Master is a very important role and we should always keep calm. For me, Scrum Master is second most senior role in a team and really acts as a shield/glue for the team
