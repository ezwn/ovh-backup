Livraisons brutes :

* la bannière bleue
* de nouveaux outils SCRUM
* un client BCS réutilisable
* import/export réutilisable
* possibilité d'éditer complètement les campagnes retirées (tech specs)
* refactoring partie "requête optimisées"

Haut niveau :

* premières interventions sur la partie "plateforme"
* meilleure alliance avec l'équipe, en particulier Felipe concernant
  * souci du découplage
  * simplicité du code
  * questions et choix de conception
* meilleures feedbacks donnés, plus réfléchis, plus adaptés
* plus de précision concernant sprints, capacité et performance

**Accomplishments**

A selection of four.

* Better integration with the team, in particular, more relevant and efficient feedbacks given, for example related to code design and practices.
* Provided better awareness of the team performance and capacity through new (low-tech) SCRUM tools. These tools were shared with 2 other teams.
* Preparing the future by conducting a difficult refactoring to restore clean code (in the campaign edition and query optimization part).
* Promotion of reusability at the team level by providing examples of reusable components : BCS import/export, Audit Logs...

**Reflection**

So far, there is no company wide generic import/export, while there could be. I am not sure if it is because of my position, or because I didn't managed to include other teams in particular BCS and to promote the ideas, but the result remains local to Engage, but could have benefit other feature teams.

I noticed Owain managed to convince BCS to develop a small library around BCS client. So it was possible.

I think it's sad for everybody that I was able to develop generic libraries that could have make the whole company win time, but wasn't able to promote them.

I suppose one of my reason is my lake of "social" skills.

**Development goals**

Would be great if I knew where, when and how to make suggestion and be persuasive to other teams. I don't even know where to start and what this is linked with.
