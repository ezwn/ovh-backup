# Mistakes to avoid

Neglecting developer environment quality (heavy environments)

Naming the repository differently than the artifact

Goulots convergents : des classes qui couplent l'intégralité d'un projet

## Nexthink

### absence of data validation

### not thinking generic, then trying to unify after months

Examples:

* different features sharing the same workflow, but implementing in their own way, with for instance status named differently (Nexthink's features).
* not creating a library and instead asking team to implement their client while it could be delivered in a library (BCS).

### not anticipating future evolutions

* storing no version number

### nql-store

### multiply technologies doing the same thing (databases: BCS/postgres, clickhouse, kafka as data source)

### multiply exchanges formats: graphql, rest, proto

### underlogging

## Credit Suisse

## MNT

### Choosing a rare and difficult technology and then struggling to find resources

## Société générale

## ING

## CEGID

## Me

### Not caring enough about training other devs
