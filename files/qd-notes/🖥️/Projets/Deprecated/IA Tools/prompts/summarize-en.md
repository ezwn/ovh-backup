Hi,
Here is a text:

1. Cleaning

Some words carry little meaning: articles, pronouns, certain prepositions, previously mentioned words, redundant or presupposed words. Remove them to save as many words as possible. In the text you generate, grammar is not important, but try to maintain the clusters of ideas from the original text.

2. Re-organization

Great. Now please reorganize the ideas from the text you just wrote by dispatching the information along a deep tree of unitary ideas. You can make connections to make the categories more relevant if necessary.

3. Export ChatGpt

Display the resulting elements in this format:

```
- Main Idea:
    - Idea 1
    - Idea 2:
        - Idea 2.1
        - Idea 2.2
        - Idea 2.3
```

4. Export MindMapping

=======================

Merci de changer le format de ceci:

```

```

Par celui-ci :

```json
{
  "IDEE PRINCIPALE": {
    "IDEE 1": {
        "IDEE 1.1": {},
        "IDEE 1.2": {}
    },
    "IDEE 2": {
        "IDEE 2.1": {},
        "IDEE 2.2": {},
        "IDEE 2.3": {}
    }
}
```
